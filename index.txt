What one needs to know in the first place is that there're 2 main types of templates: modal and inline. Modals are basically pop-ups overlapping the whole page and blocking its content. Inline templates are widgets which can be built in any block on your website â€” they can appear between article paragraphs, slide up from the very bottom, or be standalone landing pages. In these documents you will find tons of examples of using our templates, both modal and inline, and guidelines on how to implemet every particular case. Please bear in mind they are only examples, and you can figure out your own custom variant!
